# my-linux-toolkit

This repository contains scripts, configurations and writeups that I collect while learning about GNU/Linux system administration (now, mainly Debian 12) and cybersecurity. I'm always trying to learn new things. It's a personal collection, useful both for me and for anyone interested in automating tasks or improving their workflow on Linux.
